# Communication of the cardgame

## Why
Because it won fly by itself

## What


## Who
We have an officer working on the cardgame content, the graphic design and UX. She will be responsible for testing and roll-out of the cardgame, its presentation to the outside world and hopefully also the adoption of the cardgame by the target group

#### Targetgroup

Activist, socially involved and soc media aware, familiar with bitcoin to a certain extend and looking for a trusted and easy way to educate their peers and others about bitcoin and blockchain.

# Plan
- Study
- Fly cardgame
- Report

## Goals 
1. Make ./t/btc and ./t/bcb a success<br/>
    a: when there are a lot of retweets, likes<br/>
    b: as soon as the card game is mentioned on (influential) sites, telegram groups, podcasts, vodcasts<br/>
    c: when twitterers also spontaneously use it on other social media such as Facebook<br/>
    d: when they come up with proposals for cards
2. Preparatory: benchmark ./t/btc, deliver measurements and correct texts in a number of iterations
3. Proof extended knowledge in the whole spectrum of open public blockchain field, focussed on bitcoin?
4. Chart target groups and measure results in trying to address them. Mapping which target groups we distinguish and which we can best focus on
