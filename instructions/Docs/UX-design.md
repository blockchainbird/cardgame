# The UX design of the cardgame

## Briefly describe what you do and your target audience.

Open source development. This project has the objective to teach people about bitcoin and blockchain in a balanced and fair way.<br/>
There are many misconceptions about bitcoin. Fueled by parties that have an interest in keeping (the image of) bitcoin down as much as possible. <br/>
We fight this with peaceful means: a sort of weekly contest on social media (Twitter to start with). More info on https://github.com/blockchainbird/cardgame<br/>
This is a RE-desgin assignment.


## What ideas do you have for the style/theme of your website design?

All current ideas listed on https://github.com/blockchainbird/cardgame. But these ideas haven't worked out yet (people  don't use the virtual cards yet) so we need a change.

Pleas use your creativity to:<br/>
A. Discover a recent misconception in a tweet of somebody on Twitter (optionally follow the twitter stream to help you).<br/>
B. Get (find) and paste a fixed URL to one or more cards<br/>
C. Optionally change the pre-set type of response (which matches the proficiency level of the misconception)<br/>
D. Add personal message + mimes to the text before submit as an answer to the misconception<br/>

The *contest* is currently no more than a high score-list with Twitter account per week. We use Twitter API to report the number of likes, retweets and responses per account as far as the cards are concerned.
